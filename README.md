# Named-Entity-Recognition-using-Bi-LSTM-on-MultiCoNER-II-dataset
This code implements a Bidirectional LSTM model for Named Entity Recognition (NER) task. It loads data in CoNLL format and preprocesses the data by converting words and labels into indices, padding sequences, and one-hot encoding the labels.
